# ECE552 UWU Madison Spring 2024

16 bit WISC-S24 ISA with the Multicycle Pipelined Processor from Phase 2 with the addition of the cache. Memory read/write now requires 4 cycles instead of the presumed instantaneous speed from Phase 2/3. \
**To Run:** 
1. Do not use the Makeffile and run by iverilog, it hangs on compilation. Likely it is an issue with size and maybe there needs to be a configuration, but for now run it on Modelsim/Questasim
